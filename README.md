# Analysis-of-Netflix-Shows
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of Netflix Shows to understand trends, distributions, and characteristics within the dataset. The analysis involves SQL queries to investigate various attributes, relationships, and statistics of the shows. Below are the key points covered in this repository:
### Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:

- showID: Unique identifier for each show.
- title: Title of the show.
- type: Type of show (e.g., Movie, TV Show).
- director: Director(s) of the show.
- cast: Cast members.
- country: Country where the show was produced.
- date_added: Date when the show was added to Netflix.
- release_year: Year the show was released.
- rating: Rating given to the show.
- duration: Duration of the show.
- listed_in: Genre or category of the show.
- description: Description of the show.
### Difficulties Encountered
While working with the dataset, one challenge was ensuring the data types were correctly interpreted, especially for the duration column, which contains mixed data (minutes for movies and seasons for TV shows). This required careful filtering and casting to perform accurate calculations.
### Interesting Insights
One interesting insight from the analysis was the diversity of genres available on Netflix. The dataset revealed that certain genres, such as Documentaries and Stand-Up Comedy, have a significantly higher count compared to others. This reflects Netflix's strategy of catering to a wide range of audience preferences.
